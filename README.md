Developer and writer from Ukraine. Ruby programming language committer.

**Mostly interested in lucid code and open data, and writing a [Substack](https://zverok.substack.com/) about it.** The range of “my” topics are united by an urge to understand and explain. Or, the problems of knowledge acquiring (with code) and expressing meaning (with code).

_Working on my first Ruby book, working title "[41 Ruby Intuitions](https://zverok.space/writing/#ruby-intuitions)"._

## Recent/interesting work

### Ruby programming language

* [Contributions to the language](https://zverok.space/ruby.html) (new features and docs)

  * First (discontinued) attempt: [molybdenum-99](https://github.com/molybdenum-99) set of Ruby projects
  * Second (current) attempt: [WikipediaQL](https://github.com/zverok/wikipedia_ql) Python library; writing on it: [0](https://zverok.substack.com/p/wikipedia), [1](https://zverok.substack.com/p/wikipediaql-1), _TBC_

### Fun and experiments

* [Grok {Shan, Shui}\*](https://zverok.substack.com/p/grok-shan-shui) ([repo](https://github.com/zverok/grok-shan-shui)): digging into the code of [{Shan, Shui}\*](https://github.com/LingDong-/shan-shui-inf) Chinese painting generator
* [Game of Life in one Ruby statement... inspired by APL](https://zverok.space/blog/2020-05-16-ruby-as-apl.html) ([repo](https://github.com/zverok/ruby_as_apl))
